# Record
#
# A simple representation of an object passed in
# to Newsroom.js. It doesn't necessarily have to
# be a database record, but it probably will be.
#
# It can be anything... this class just provides
# a means to interact with it.
#
# Attach it to a user so you can pass it back
# and forth between Client and Server-side
# without thinking about it.
#
# Don't use a collection here, because we don't
# want to be passing around potentially out-of-date
# data
#
